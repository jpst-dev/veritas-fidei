# Project AI Rules

- All my inputs will be in Portuguese, but always translate and interpret them as if I had written them in English before processing. Use the intended meaning, not a literal translation.
- Always respond in Portuguese.
- This is a front-end project using Vue 3 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Vite.
- Always use composition API (`<script setup>`) and modern Vue best practices.
- Follow Tailwind utility-first approach and keep HTML structure clean.
- Prioritize accessibility and responsiveness.
- Use semantic HTML whenever possible.
- Use PascalCase for component names and kebab-case for file names.
- Code should be clean, reusable, and easy to maintain.
- If a design decision is needed, assume it's part of a clean, minimalist UI with good UX.
- Suggest improvements in code structure, naming or logic when appropriate.
- Avoid inline styles and unnecessary complexity.
- Testing (if included) should be done using Vitest and Vue Testing Library.
- State management is done using Pinia.
- Vue Router is configured and used for navigation.
- API calls should use Axios.
- Feel free to create, rename, move, or refactor files or folders when needed to improve code quality or structure.
- You may suggest and implement architectural changes or reorganize logic when appropriate.


Optional:
- You can reference files using `@/` alias.
- Use Markdown to format responses clearly if needed.
